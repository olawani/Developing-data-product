## Introduction

This project is built as part of Developing Data Products final project. This consists of two parts - 

1. Create a Shiny apllication and deploy on ShinnyApps servers.
2. Create a markdown file(Slidy presentation) to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation.

## Shiny App

- In this project a simple Shiny Application is created, which calculate BMI of a person given his/her weight and height as inputs.

### BMI Calculation Algorithm

- BMI = Weight(in KG) / (height(in CM)/100 * height(in CM)/100)

- For example: If a persom weights 50 KG & 160cm tall, then BMI would be = 50 / (160/100 * 160/100) = 19.53125

## Shiny App and Source Code links
